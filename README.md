# Daniel's Home Assistant Configuration

## About

Quote from [niro1987](https://github.com/niro1987/homeassistant-config) 
> This is my Home Assistant configuration inspired by [Frenck's methodology](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) of having each file doing only one thing. 
>
> I chose this methodology because I like the way how the integrations are organized. I don't have to spend time looking through long files to find what I'm looking for. To add or to remove an integration is as easy as creating or removing a file.

There is not much more to say.

Both configuration repos where used as reference during the setup of my own configuration
